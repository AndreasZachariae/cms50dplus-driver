# OXYMETER CMS50E raw real time ppg Value
Raw ppg data from cms50e device

This repository allows you to record the raw live data from the cms50e and and save them in a file. You can edit it to plot these real time ppg value.


## Usage
*NB : There are apparently different versions of the cms50e. Not having found a code allowing me to retrieve the data from the version I had, I created this one. Moreover, the difference between the versions is often the serial opening baud and the real time raw data exchange protocol. With a little luck, you will find anyway other repository related to these versions.*

Follow these instructions to retrieve raw real time data from the cms50e with this program.
1. Install python3 and the corresponding pip program
2. Install pyserial librarie by entering in a shell : `pip3 install pyserial`
3. Put your finger in the oximeter, turn it on, then plug into the PC. Make sure that it works well, i.e. that you can see the ppg curve vary on his screen before proceeding to the next step.
4. Run `cms50e.py` script passing to it as argument the port where the device is plug and the raw binary data output file: `python3 cms50e.py COM6 data.txt`. In Ubuntu, the command is something like `python3 cms50e.py \dev\ttyUSB0 data.txt`
5. Press `^C` to stop the recording when you have enought data.
6. Run the script `decod.py` to convert theses raw data to ppg values into a file, from where you can read to operate on Matlab for example : `python3 decod.py data.txt ppg.txt`. `data.txt` is the preview raw data output file and `ppg.txt` is the file which contains line by line ppg values. Now you can process this in Matlab or python to get the ppg curve.

## Few remarks
- The Sampling frequency of the device is 60Hz
- 60 time per second, the device send 7 bytes to the PC. The last two bytes seems to be always `ffff`, which i used as a delimitor
- the 4th byte contains, at his first 6 bits, the encoded raw ppg value
- To understand more about this protocol, please refers to : [Alex Robinson](https://www.tranzoa.net/~alex/blog/?p=371) and [Asbj√∏rn Brask](https://www.atbrask.dk/?author=1)'s articles. It seems however that the encoding and protocol described by these articles are not always valid for my version of the CMS50e device. I stopped the investigation when the data I obtained was indeed a typical ppg curve, whose deduced Heart Rate value was moreover equal to the one displayed by the device.
