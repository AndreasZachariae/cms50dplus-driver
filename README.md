# CMS50E-raw-ppg-data
Raw ppg data from cms50e device

This repository allows you to record the raw live data from the cms50e. You can edit it to plot these real time ppg value.

## Usage
*NB : There are apparently different versions of the cms50e. Not having found a code allowing me to retrieve the data from the version I had, I created this one. Moreover, the difference between the versions is often the serial opening baud and the real time raw data exchange protocol. With a little luck, you will find anyway other repository related to these versions.*

Follow these instructions to retrieve raw real time data from the cms50e with this program.
1. Install python3 and the corresponding pip program
2.
